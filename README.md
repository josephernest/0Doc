Installation
----
Just open `index.html` and that's it!

To edit your own documentation, write it in Markdown syntax inside the `<div id="content"> ... </div>`. 
The table of contents will be automatically generated on the fly. No other tool needed.

You can also:

* Modify `<title>...</title>` with your own title

* Use your own `logo.png` file


Why another static documentation generator ?
----

I discovered the great [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) project, but it requires to install `Ruby`, `bundler`, and it's just another layer on top of [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) static website generator, which does most of the work. As I'm not a user of all these tools, I didn't find it confortable for me.

Moreover I don't like having to run a command to re-render HTML files each time you modify the documentation (that's often the case with static websites generators).

That's why I decided to write this simple solution **that doesn't require any tool like** Ruby, Python, Perl, etc. The output is rendered on the fly when you open `index.html`.

In short, this means that you just have to edit your `index.html`, and not worry about anything else.

Todo
----

We are currently testing this feature: include external files with a simple line inside `<div id="content"> ... </div>`:

    <file src="chapter1.md"></file>

[This is an example of use](https://josephernest.github.io/0Doc-chip) for C.H.I.P.'s documentation, forked from http://docs.getchip.com/chip.html.
